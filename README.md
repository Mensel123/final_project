# Forest Growth
Final project of Dataprocessing

## Problem statement
Trees are essential for the existence of human beings. Without them we would
simply not be able to breath. According to Bradford et al. (2015) 15 billion
trees are cut each year. But where do all these threes come from? And which
countries produce the most trees? Can we create more awareness, among people that
do not live in countries where forests are cut every day, for the cutting of
forests by making an interactive visualisation?

## Solution
I have created an interactive website that visualizes the forest area change from 1990 up to 2015.

### Visualisation

### Main features


### Data sources:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS
This dataset contains forest area of % land area for many countries. I have used this dataset to create my visualisations.

### External components:
D3 library  
Pandas
jQuery
Bootstrap
