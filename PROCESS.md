# day 2
In my proposal I linked to a dataset from the globalforestwatch. This dataset
was almost complete but lacked a crucial element, namely the growth of trees
overtime, it only showed the decrease overtime. Therefore I decided to search
for a new dataset. I found this on the World Bank site. This dataset is however
less detailed in that it only shows change overtime and says nothing about
cutting or planting trees. It does however show the change overtime which is
crucial for answering my question.  

Furthermore I decided to work with one json file. So I merged the csv and tsv
file into one json. Ik heb hem eerst in een pandas dataframe gezet om overzicht
te krijgen:
