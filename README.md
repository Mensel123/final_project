Final project of Dataprocessing

## Problem statement
Trees are essential for the existence of human beings. Without them we would
simply not be able te breath. According to Bradford et al. (2015) 15 billion
trees are cut each year. But where do all these threes come from? And which
countries produce the most trees? Can we create more awareness, among people that
do not live in countries where forests are cut every day, for the cutting of
forests by making an interactive visualisation?

## Solution
I would like to create an interactive map that visualizes the amount of wood
thats being cut per country over the years.

### Visualisation

### Main features
MVP:
* Interactive world map, cliking on the map shows additional information
* Linechart that shows the amount of wood that was cut in a perticular country

Optional:
* Interactive world map with slidebar to show change over years
* Toggle option to show trees planted over the years
* Adding charts to show trees planted vs trees cut over years
